# Tailwind CSS - Add to .gitignore

# Node modules (if not already ignored)
node_modules/

# Tailwind output CSS (auto-generated, should be rebuilt)
# OPTION 1: If you want to commit the built CSS (recommended for simple deployments)
# Leave tailwind-output.css tracked

# OPTION 2: If you want to build during deployment (CI/CD pipeline)
# wwwroot/css/tailwind-output.css

# NPM/Package manager files to keep tracked
# package.json (KEEP - contains scripts)
# package-lock.json (KEEP - locks dependency versions)
# tailwind.config.js (KEEP - contains configuration)
# wwwroot/css/tailwind-input.css (KEEP - source file)

# Recommendation: Keep tailwind-output.css committed for easier deployment
# Build it locally with: npm run build:css
